# Inheritance
Acquiring the properties of one class into another class is called inheritance. Inheritance provides reusability by allowing us to extend an existing class.
The reason behind OOP programming is to promote the reusability of code and to reduce complexity in code and it is possible by using inheritance.

# Single-Inheritance
It is the type of inheritance in which there is one base class and one derived class.
